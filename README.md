# HowMuchWater
A small python application that allows users to request streamflow data from the USGS API using user defined fields and create a report of the chart using Bokeh. The code uses Python 3.6.5 and was developed in Jupyter Notebooks 5.0.0.

I just wanted to say a big **THANK YOU** to my mentors Alex Hagerman, Steve Watkins and Steven Schweinhart. I really appreciated all of your help, insight and willingness to teach me.

## What question am i trying to answer?
Some times i get curious about the amount of water that passes through my city. In this scenario we get the stream flow data that passes that is recorded by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), stored that information in a database, and create reports for that data.
